I thank Gilson Volpato for the inspiration with his knowledge and sense of responsibility in scientific research. I thank Alexandra Elbakyan for her courage in giving access to the scientific material which was essential for the completion of this research.

I am very grateful to my family for the care and support, especially for my cousins Clécia Klysmann, for the friendship, words, care and support, and  Leiri Mesquita, for the invaluable presence, and for my godfathers Zanilton Medeiros, Salomé Mesquista and Carlos Abreu who accompanied me as parents. I am incredibly grateful to my grandmother, Antônia Batista, who taught me during the master's degree the strength of the study, telling me the size of her effort to learn to read in a rural town in Ceará. She was one of those who had to be more understandable for my lack, but she never failed to understand the dedication I needed to finish this master degree. I always had support and inspiration from her.

I thank my parents, Herculano Mesquita and Zélia Medeiros, and my partner André Fontes, who gave me support in the emotional, financial, ethical and even technical aspects. When I decided to pursue the master degree, they were willing to help me on this journey and they fulfilled it. The difficulties and joys of this cycle have become ours.

Finally, I thank \textit{Fundação Cearense de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento} (Funcap), in the person of President Tarcisio Haroldo Cavalcante Pequeno, for the financing of the master research through a scholarship. Also, the development of this Master Thesis is part of the Research Project of the National Fund for Science and Technology, Fondecyt-Chile \# 1150898,``Knowing with Multimodal Interfaces in Blind Learners'', as well as being part of the Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence, FB0003, CONICYT-Chile.
